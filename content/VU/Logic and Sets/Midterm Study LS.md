# Relations
- **Reflexive**: Every element is also related to itself

```mermaid
flowchart TD

A --> A
B --> B
C --> C
D --> D
```
- **Transitive**: Whenever there is a relation $a \rightarrow b$ and $b \rightarrow c$, then R also relates $a \rightarrow c$
```mermaid
flowchart LR

A --> B
B --> C
A --> C
```
- **Symmetric**:
- **Anti-symmetric**: There is ==not a single mutual relationship== between any node
