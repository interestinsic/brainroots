This is a first testing Note, that uses all kind of stuff lol

# Cheat Sheet
> Preferrably Memorized, for speed

- Powers of 2
- Simbols for base 16
- Formulas of all Logic gates
- How to implement every logic gate based on the Universal ones

****

> I feel like what will be in the exam is just about the exercises they did during the tutorials.
# To Know / Understand

## Theoretical Base
### First computers and their hardware

### Laws

## Practical stuff

### Karnaugh Maps
